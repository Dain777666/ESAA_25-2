battery yet, and I've been coast to coast with it, waits, etc .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It is a big battery, and it does tend to tip backwards if fully opened and placed on a flat surface .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Bluetooth narrowed it down, battery life narrowed it further, ability to R&R the memory was a further contraint, and when I was done it was this model or an MSI Wind .\\n53

.\\n54                                                                                                                                                              Recently, however, my battery was about to die, and I had already set up shop in another room of my house, so I decided to move the power cord to the other room with my computer and let it charge while I worked on it .\\n55

                                                                                                                                                       If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n57

has a solid feel to it  , but the battery juts out quite a bit, the touchpad keys are terribly placed, the webcam is only 0 .\\n58

                                                 Since then, I've used it exclusively on battery power .\\n59

                          has an 11  screen with the same or better battery life, .\\n60

tried to charge the computer using the supplied battery charger .\\n61

became useless once the onboard battery ran down .\\n62

even while watching hours of  .\\n63

                                                        5 hour battery is the real deal ,  I had my unit on for 10 hours and it was still running with just over 10% battery capacity remaining .\\n65

love this machine for the purposes I bought it, portability, battery life to carry me through travels and for my teenager to use .\\n68

                         5 battery life was just a claim, but charged at %100 my battery life clocked in 10 .\\n69

                                    The battery life on this thing is truly incredible .\\n70

an hour and a half battery life left before I decided to charge it .\\n71

netbook in excellent fashion .\\n73                                                                                                                                   My only other gripe is the speakers are very weak for media use, but there are pocket, able battery powered speaker options, I am using the Altec Lansing Orbit Altec Lansing iM, 237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players  , which is great .\\n74

functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

and turn down the screen brightness .\\n156  One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157

you're on a plane where you don't need full brightness or radio anyway .\\n195

disappointing and produces eye fatigue .\\n12                                                                                                  I had old favorites, and some classics that we're told we should read, samples that had caught my eye, and lots of new choices , ,  and I held them all in my hand .\\n13  I know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought .\\n14                                                                                                                       And with the Kindle, I can adjust the font to any of six different sizes, which is of some importance to those with poor vision or tired eyes .\\n15

                                                                                                           I know some people are really upset about the no backlight issue, but I'm glad because it is not as straining on my eyes as a computer screen .\\n18                                                                                                                                                         I read for 2 hours in the middle of the night last night and my husband never knew, and my eyes didn't hurt .\\n19                                  Text to speech is adequate, I don't see myself using this feature too much, but it's a lot better than nothing when you need both hands free, and it would be a truly fantastic feature for anyone with poor eyesight or blindness .\\n20

screen is amazing & the one thing that kept me from reading on into the night constantly eyestrain is NO LONGER a CONCERN !\\n22

easy on the eyes, I like it better than an actual book .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                      0 out of 5 stars A great tool for those of us with aging eyes, February 28, 2009\\n25                                                   The text, bumped up two magnification levels, is sharp and clear enough for me to make out, and while I've seen some criticism of the gray page background, I actually find it easier on my eyes than stark white .\\n26                                                                 For those of us in the Boomer bulge whose eyesight is failing and taking with it the pleasure of reading ,  and for those with other forms of visual impairment ,  it's nothing less than a miracle .\\n27                                                                                                                                         As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .\\n28

                                                                                                                                             I have been keeping an eye on the Kindle since the first was brought out and did a lot of research on this product .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                    and that is why it's easy on the eyes and uses very little power .\\n31

center, which caused me to experience severe eye, strain .\\n33                                                                                                                                            Even without the back light, within fifteen minutes of reading on the sony reader due to the glare, my eyes were hurting .\\n34

distributed onto the screen which causes  no  eye strain .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                      Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .\\n37                                                                                                           And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                 First of all, the Kindle 2 is very easy on the eyes .\\n39                                                                                 Some have said they don't like the black text on a greyish background, but I find the contrast not only more than adequate but easier on the eyes than if the background were white .\\n40                                                                                                                                  A backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .\\n41                                                                                                        I won't be using the feature much anyway because I get a lot more out of a book I'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .\\n42



                                                                                                                                               Not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .\\n48                                                                                                                           With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .\\n49

for reading than the glossy or matte computer screens .\\n54                                                                                                                                                     The screen size is close enough to the size of a paperback book page that it hasn't caused my eyes any problems .\\n55

                                              I can strain to read the text but then close my eye for awhile and listen .\\n58

my eyes are much less tired by using a bigger font .\\n63                                                                                                                                                 The screen is less obtrusive than the white of a book page, which also helps my eyes from growing tired too quickly .\\n64

                                                     Now with the Kindle 2, I can change the print to suit my eyes and further, I can make more intelligent choices of books because I have more

         I am amazed at how easy the E Ink is on the eyes, the slight shadowing from page to page does not bother me .\\n73                                                                                                                 The screen is easy on the eyes, easy to learn, easy to turn pages, and the device is more comfortable than a real book or trying to hold the iphone .\\n74                                                                                                                                            The print is easy on the eye and the light weight of the device and easy

an hour and a half battery life left before I decided to charge it .\\n71

speakers are very weak for media use, but there are pocket, able battery powered speaker options, I am using the Altec Lansing Orbit Altec Lansing iM, 237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players

                                    I expected six or seven hours in reality, , I'm aware that battery life claims, like MPGs with cars, are usually puffed up .\\n77

never have to worry about sitting near a power outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a

                                                                                                                                                                                      This thing is so easy on the eyes, I like it better than an actual book .\\n24                                                                                                                                                                                      0 out of 5 stars A great tool for those of us with aging eyes, February 28, 2009\\n25                                                   The text, bumped up two magnification levels, is sharp and clear enough for me to make out, and while I've seen some criticism of the gray page background, I actually find it easier on my eyes than stark white .\\n26                                                                 For those of us in the Boomer bulge whose eyesight is failing and taking with it the pleasure of reading ,  and for those with other forms of visual impairment ,  it's nothing less than a miracle .\\n27                                                                                                                                         As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                     I am loving the whole concept and read almost a whole book last night with no eye strain at all .\\n29                                                                                                                                                  I have been keeping an eye on the Kindle since the first was brought out and did a lot of research on this product .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                    and that is why it's easy on the eyes and uses very little power .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                               I use that as well when it gets late and my eyes tire .\\n32                                                                                                                                       The lights are casted from the side of the reader fusing towards the center, which caused me to experience severe eye, strain .\\n33                                                                                                                                            Even without the back light, within fifteen minutes of reading on the sony reader due to the glare, my eyes were hurting .\\n34

                                                                                                                                                              The illuminence of the light is equally distributed onto the screen which causes  no  eye strain .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                      Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .\\n37                                                                                                           And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                 First of all, the Kindle 2 is very easy on the eyes .\\n39                                                                                 Some have said they don't like the black text on a greyish background, but I find the contrast not only more than adequate but easier on the eyes than if the background were white .\\n40                                                                                                                                  A backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .\\n41                                                                                                        I won't be using the feature much anyway because I get a lot more out of a book I'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .\\n42



                                                                                                                                               Not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .\\n48                                                                                                                           With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .\\n49

                    The screen is so easy on the eyes .\\n51                                                                                                    The Kindle does not have a screen that taxes the eyes, and allows me to shift some of my time away from the computer for blogs that I would normally read online .\\n52

                                                                                                                                              I do think the e, ink e, paper is a lot easier on my eyes for reading than the glossy or matte computer screens .\\n54                                                                                                                                                     The screen size is close enough to the size of a paperback book page that it hasn't caused my eyes any problems .\\n55

strain your eyes and reads better than a printed page .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                           I can strain to read the text but then close my eye for awhile and listen .\\n58

my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !\\n32

front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

in the back and the seats a very supportive .\\n37

                                                             I feel uncomfortable driving this car and will get rid of it .\\n21

and has good road manner, and overall it is a good car .\\n25                                                                                                                          I'd highly

                                                 You can not get that comfort with any other automaker other than perhaps Honda .\\n27

stiff suspension or it's smooth and comfortable on the road .\\n31                                                                                                                                 The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                    For the comfort and entertainment of the ride, I like the Camry .\\n33

                                                           I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                    I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                       The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39

                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47

   Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49                                                                                                                                                           Feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my Grand Prix .\\n50

generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound

                                                  The seats are way to low to the ground making long drives uncomfortable .\\n74

                                                                        Toyota made many improvements since 03, including more comfortable front seats, better rear seat room and comfort   .\\n76

straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive .\\n78                                                                                                                                           My passengers are expecially happy with it and love the room, comfort, and adjustability .\\n79                                                                                                 On longer trips, however, they have a tendency to fall asleep, , which I think emphasizes how comfortable, smooth, and quiet it is .\\n80

             I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 The navigation works

have to say the car rode great,comfortable and gas mileage great .\\n84                                                                                                                                   I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a comfortable ride as well as good fuel economy .\\n85                                                                                                                             The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86

                                                                                                                                                    Comfortable and quiet with excellent gas mileage

expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91

                                                The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                            It is so comfortable and drives perfect .\\n96                                                                                                              Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97

                    I only have a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats

after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :\\n102                                                                                                                           the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .\\n103                                                                                        Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104

                 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature, and a fuel consumption that is best in the class .\\n107                                                                                                                                              Nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .\\n108

                                                          The car is VERY comfortable and the air conditioning is perfect for the heat here in Arizona .\\n110

far, no problems .\\n37                                                                                                                              Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38                                                                                                                                                          The manual transmission lets me control the car better and achieve higher mileage .\\n39                                                                                                                                                  So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40

                                                                                                                                                               Our 2008 Accord is very disappointing, our in town mileage is 14 .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                Gets great gas mileage, I mostly drive city and I am currently receiving 25 .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                       I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                             My BMW 530i got better mileage .\\n48                                                                                                   It is fun to

driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                             I am so very disappointed with the gas mileage !\\n53

                                                                                                                              It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                   Strangely, the gas mileage is not as good as the Acura but is acceptable .\\n58

                                                                                                                    Gas mileage is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62                                                                                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63                                                                                                                                      I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$

fact from fiction or even to tell whether or not someone was having a bad day when they arrived or left or whether or not a guest was rude him herself and thus caused the hotel staff to be standoffish or what .\\n33

encountered doesn\\u0092t sound anything like the staff some reviewers have mentioned .\\n35

.\\n32                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !\\n33                                                                                                                                                      I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .\\n34

not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .\\n36

.\\n39                                                                                                                                                                               There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .\\n40                                                                                                                                                  The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                       Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .\\n42                                                     One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .\\n44                                                                                                               At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .\\n45

.\\n46                                                                                                                             We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47

excellant food and service .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                    Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n52

        However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .\\n62

work in some units .\\n38

                                                             Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44

        The bathroom was large and private .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                              The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

               The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

there was a hairdryer .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

very nice .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                                                         The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

       Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

by the bathroom sink .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                        The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

    The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75

our room .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .\\n77

but more importantly spot on directions .\\n6                                                 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7                                                                                                       But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .\\n8

              Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11

and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .\\n33

need to take .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Directions seemed to focus on Interstate travel and I have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .\\n35

satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .\\n36

.\\n39

1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42

work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44

                 The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .\\n46

          It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going

                    I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49

                                     As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n50

directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52

get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54

on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55

the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56
